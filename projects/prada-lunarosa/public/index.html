				<h2>Daniel Fuchs</h2>
				<h3><a class="gq-red" href="https://www.instagram.com/magic_fox/">@magic_fox</a></h3>
				
				<p>The German influencer uses a morning run to clear his mind. <em>&#8220;It's the only part of the day where I have my silence,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I don't want to think about any to-do list, any tasks I have. I just want to enjoy the moment—to enjoy that I'm free.&#8221;</em></p>
 
				<p>That enjoyment can be contagious. Under the moniker Magic Fox, Fuchs has amassed 1.3 million Instagram followers over the past few years. He'll get messages from fans saying that his posts inspired them to get up and work out rather than sleeping in an extra hour. <em>&#8220;The feedback I get is amazing. It provides me so much motivation to keep doing what I do.&#8221;</em></p>
 
				<p>Fuchs travels constantly, making his morning run a way for him to regain control over his busy life. Success is not about pushing yourself over the edge, he explains. <em>&#8220;I have much respect for hard work. But you also have to find a balance—something that is grounding you, that calms you down.&#8221;</em></p>

				<p>For Fuchs, running and working out is where he finds his &#8220;power for the day,&#8221; especially within the focused moment of his morning jog. Fuchs does not check email or listen to music over breakfast. Then he comes out of the shower and puts on a fragrance that helps him feel<em>&#8220;unbeatable.&#8221;</em></p>

				<p>Prada Luna Rossa Sport combines vibrant, unexpected notes (ginger, juniper berries, lavender, tobacco-inflected vanilla) that evoke the emotions behind athletic challenge. <em>&#8220;It's nice to have a great fragrance which fits to you and to your moment,&#8221; says Fuchs—whose peak moment is the morning.</em></p>

				<h2>Blake Scott</h2>
				<h3><a class="gq-red" href="https://www.instagram.com/blakescott_/">@blakescott_</a></h3>
				
				<p>Scott's afternoons can be hard to predict, and that's the point. <em>&#8220;I can never pinpoint what I'm gonna do, who I'm gonna meet, or what city I'm gonna be in,&#8221; he says. &#8220;And because that part of my day is so spontaneous, I'm able to grab the most out of it. I get most of my creativity from the afternoons.&#8221;</em></p>

				<p>As a lifestyle trendsetter, Scott's specialty is the art of style. The idea of the well-dressed gentleman captivated him as a kid, inspiring him to put more thought into dressing—to make an effort to stand out, even if it meant testing the limits of his self-confidence. </p>

				<p>No dapper ensemble, he adds, is complete without the perfect fragrance. <em>&#8220;I feel a man's scent is one of the most important things he can have when dressing up.&#8221;</em>  Prada's Luna Rossa Carbon is distinctive for its mineral freshness, an energetic scent that filters earthy notes through the elegant and optimizing lens of modern industry.  It's a scent for the gentleman of today, however you define him.</p>

				<p><em>&#8220;For me, the gentleman is somebody who cares about himself inside and out. He's a man of the world, somebody who knows a little bit about everything,&#8221;</em> Scott explains. He makes the ideal come to life during photo and video shoots, usually in his hometown of Los Angeles.</p>

				<p><em>&#8220;My peak moment throughout the day is when I'm actually shooting, when I'm outside working,&#8221;</em> Scott says. <em>&#8220;It's me and the photographer and we're getting the best out of each other. It's about finding the right location, being in the right corner—about just being me.&#8221;</em></p>

				<h2>Patrick Janelle</h2>
				
				<h3><a class="gq-red" href="https://www.instagram.com/aguynamedpatrick/">@aguynamedpatrick</a></h3>

				<p>For Janelle, the transformative effects of personal style are amplified after dark. Sensual and dynamic, anchored by a radically modern interpretation of lavender, Prada Luna Rossa Eau de Toilette is the fragrance for this pivotal moment. <em>&#8220;When everybody has settled into the evening, connections are being made,&#8221;</em> Janelle says. <em>&#8220;It's when I'm a host that I think I'm at my peak.&#8221;</em></p>

				<p>Hosting is one of the things Janelle does well—but not the only one. He has nearly 500,000 followers on Instagram, where ‘A Guy Named Patrick' posts about travel, food, interior design, and men's style. But Janelle flexes his creative powers offline even more. As cofounder of Spring Street Social Society, he designs private member events in offbeat spaces: salons, multi-course dinners, a cabaret show with a secret pop-up concert. <em>&#8220;Our goal is really just to create moments that people can't forget,&#8221;</em> he explains.</p>

				<p>An adopted New Yorker, his mission has been to remake the city into <em>&#8220;the place I always dreamed it would be.&#8221;</em> Though he doesn't go clubbing like he used to, Janelle's vision of that ideal is still a nighttime one. <em>&#8220;I love to be in a busy restaurant, or at a party, where I am surrounded by people who are happy and excited about the lives that they are living,&#8221;</em> he says.</p> 

				<p>The right scent—like Prada Luna Rossa's fresh, energetic new Eau de Toilette, with elements of woody amber and bitter orange—channels that excitement like nothing else. <em>&#8220;Everything about the way that I present myself to the world is important. But it's really fragrance that allows me to connect individually with someone in a surprising, memorable way.&#8221;</em></p>
